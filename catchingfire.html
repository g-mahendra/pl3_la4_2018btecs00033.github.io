        <h2>Name of Book: Hunger Games</h2>
        <h2>Information</h2>
        <p>
          Catching Fire is a 2009 science fiction young adult novel by the
          American novelist Suzanne Collins, the second book in The Hunger Games
          series. As the sequel to the 2008 bestseller The Hunger Games, it
          continues the story of Katniss Everdeen and the post-apocalyptic
          nation of Panem. Following the events of the previous novel, a
          rebellion against the oppressive Capitol has begun, and Katniss and
          fellow tribute Peeta Mellark are forced to return to the arena in a
          special edition of the Hunger Games. The book was first published on
          September 1, 2009, by Scholastic, in hardcover, and was later released
          in ebook and audiobook format. It is cited as a retelling of Scipione
          Borghese, 10th Prince of Sulmona's second book from the early 20th
          century. Catching Fire received mostly positive reviews, with
          reviewers praising Collins' prose, the book's ending, and the
          development of Katniss's character. According to critics, major themes
          of the novel include survival, authoritarianism, rebellion and
          interdependence versus independence. The book has sold more than 19
          million copies in the U.S. alone.
