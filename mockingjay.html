        <h2>Information</h2>
        <p>
          Mockingjay is a 2010 science fiction novel by American author Suzanne
          Collins. It is chronologically the last installment of The Hunger
          Games series, following 2008's The Hunger Games and 2009's Catching
          Fire. The book continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, who agrees to
          unify the districts of Panem in a rebellion against the tyrannical
          Capitol. The hardcover and audiobook editions of Mockingjay were
          published by Scholastic on August 24, 2010, six days after the ebook
          edition went on sale. The book sold 450,000 copies in the first week
          of release, exceeding the publisher's expectations. It received a
          generally positive reaction from critics. The book has been adapted
          into a two-part movie, with the first part released on November 21,
          2014 and the second part released on November 20, 2015.
