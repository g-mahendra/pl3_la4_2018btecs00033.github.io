        <h2>Name of Book: Hunger Games</h2>
        <h2>Information</h2>
        <p>
          The Hunger Games is a 2008 dystopian novel by the American writer
          Suzanne Collins. It is written in the voice of 16-year-old Katniss
          Everdeen, who lives in the future, post-apocalyptic nation of Panem in
          North America. The Capitol, a highly advanced metropolis, exercises
          political control over the rest of the nation. The Hunger Games is an
          annual event in which one boy and one girl aged 12â€“18 from each of the
          twelve districts surrounding the Capitol are selected by lottery to
          compete in a televised battle royale to the death. The book received
          critical acclaim from major reviewers and authors. It was praised for
          its plot and character development. In writing The Hunger Games,
          Collins drew upon Greek mythology, Roman gladiatorial games, and
          contemporary reality television for thematic content. The novel won
          many awards, including the California Young Reader Medal, and was
          named one of Publishers Weekly's "Best Books of the Year" in 2008.
